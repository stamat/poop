A super simple bundler for simple web projects.

----

Why doesn't anyone maintain GULP anymore? Why does Parcel hate config files? Why are Rollup and Webpack so complex to setup for simple tasks? Why is the NODE community making packageception packages? What's going on?

I'm tired... Tired of bullshit... I just want to bundle my scss/sass and/or my js/ts to css and iife js, by providing input and output paths for both/one. That's it. The f**king end.

This is a bundler written for me and those like me.
